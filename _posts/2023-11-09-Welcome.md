# Hello!

Welcome to the Poly.Tech club website! This will be a place to post information about the club, as well as posts detailing what the club is up to and blog posts from member about projects they're working on. I hope this site can be useful to all and provide a place to share stuff.

The site is currently being maintained by me (Gavin), but we will need an editor (maybe Josh?). If anyone is up for that, just let me know on the club discord.

If you want to make a post, just tell me. I want to make this as accessible and easy as possible to do. There's going to be a pretty wide range of articles, so if you have anything technical-related you want to talk about, even if it's not club related, be my guest.

Enjoy the site everyone!
