## how to make a post

*This section is more for (future) maintainers, if you're an author just contact the maintainer (currently Gavin) to help you with this.*

Make sure you have an entry in _data/authors.yml, as well as a page in _authors. Then just add a file to the _posts folder with the filename YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.md, and make sure it has this front matter:

```md
---
title: Post title!!!!
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM
author: author-id
categories: [TOP_CATEGORY, SUB_CATEGORY]
tags: [TAGS]
---
(rest of your post goes here)
```
